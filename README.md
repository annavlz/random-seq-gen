assuming you have Python 3 installed (to check run `python3 --version`, you should see something like `python 3.9.10`)
in the Terminal run `git clone https://github.com/annavlz/random-seq-gen.git`
then `cd random-seq-gen`
then change `input.txt` file by adding the sequence you want ot work with as a comma separated list "1,6,1,0"
then `python script1.py` or `python script2.py`

Script1: will create a matrix of the size of the string and then randomly will pick the numbers without repeating itself. 
Script1: will ask you what size the output you want to be and then will pick up the numbers from the matrix till the string reaches its size, but matrix cells might repeat.
